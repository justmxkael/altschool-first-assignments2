                <!-- Brief Introduction -->
                Hi, my name is Ademide! I am 22 years old and would describe myself as someone who takes a keen interest in how computers function and the kind of future they can foster. 
                
                <br><br>
    
                <!-- Detialed Introduction (HTML) -->
                Whilst the various aspects of computing are intriguing, I am most enthralled by web development and software construction. Thus, in the past new year, I hastily began codecademy courses to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to launch myself into the software engineering career space. I started with HTML which was rather easy and moved onto CSS upon completion.
    
                <br><br>
                
                <!-- Detialed Introduction (CSS + JS) -->
                Learning CSS was also quite easy but not without challenges. It was very information dense and designing certain elements such as cards proved more difficult than expected; centering a div was also easy (to forget). However, it was undeniably enjoyable working through the various bugs I encountered and continuous practice made these issues less frequent. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                My initial journey with intermediate JavaSript was smooth and I quickly grasped the basics including code refactoring. However, I struggled with getters and setters, and some topics afterwards. I am hoping AltSchool would be able to better assist me in understanding of complex JavaScript topics.
    
                <br><br>

                <!-- Lack Of Collabroation -->
                Despite the amazing learning experience codecademy provides, it is not a collaborative enerivonment which I which I believe would have helped me a lot in completing the intermediate JavaScript course. This led to a programming break and eventually my signup with AltSchool Africa where work with like minded individuals is assured. I am a student in their School Of Engineering and this is my <strong id="altschool-id" style="background-color: #eafa5e;">AltSchool ID: ALT/SOE/024/0177</strong>.

        <!-- Goal At Altschool -->
        <h2 class="section-title">MY GOALS WITH ALTSCHOOL</h2>

        <section class="goals-container">
            <p id="goals">
                <strong>What I seek to achieve from AltSchool are simple:</strong> <br>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Learn how to integrate JavaScript with HTML documents to create dynamic webistes</li>
                    <li>Garner the necessary skills to be a successful and well contributing member in the field of software engineering</li>
                    <li>Work and connect with individuals who are driven by the same passion as myself</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <h2 id="conclusion" class="section-title">CONCLUSION</h2>

        <section class="conclusion-container">
            <p>
                My journey in coding has been one of frustration and satisfaction; an eye-opening experience to the amount of work and complex thought process behind the websites we visit on a day to day basis, and highlighting the importance of logical thinking. I look forward to encountering more of these problems and believe AltSchool's School Of Engineering will better equip me with the software and collaborative skills needed to tackle the varying software issues that will inevitably rise in my programming journey.
